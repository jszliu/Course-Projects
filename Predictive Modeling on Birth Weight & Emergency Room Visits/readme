This repository presents two statistical modeling problems focused on real-world health-related datasets for Categorical Data Analysis Final Project:

ðŸ”¹ Problem 1 â€“ Predicting Low Birth Weight
We aim to build a model that predicts whether an infant will be born with low birth weight using maternal and medical data.

Dataset: 189 observations with features such as mother's age, weight, smoking status, hypertension, premature labor history, and prenatal visits.

Method: Logistic Regression

Model Selection: Stepwise AIC and BIC-based feature selection

Final Model: Selected via AIC, includes interaction terms and significant medical predictors

Accuracy: 74.6%

ðŸ”¹ Problem 2 â€“ Modeling ER Visits for Heart Disease Patients
This problem involves predicting the number of emergency room visits by heart disease patients using insurance and health claim data.

Dataset: 788 observations with predictors like treatment cost, age, gender, drugs prescribed, and complications

Method: Poisson Regression

Approach:

Compared untransformed and square-root transformed models

Included interaction terms with gender

Model Selection: Stepwise AIC

Final Model: Untransformed predictors with significant coefficients

Note: The goodness-of-fit test suggested the model may not fully capture underlying complexity

ðŸ§ª Techniques Used
Logistic & Poisson Regression (GLM)

Stepwise Model Selection (AIC/BIC)
